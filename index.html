                    <h2>Goals and Aspirations</h2>

                <p class="Explanation">

                      I will make movies that encrypt actual community,
                    and methods of solving the problems found in daily life.
                    I know that some people choose not to see my race as a significant
                    people. It bothers me that I can't reach out to them because,
                    they put their trust in stereotypes shown on T.V. and the lies fed to them 
                    by their predecessors. Rather than expereicning for themselves the other colors
                    on the paint pallete. In the far but close future I know that I'll show examples of people solving or doing their 
                    best in  whatever situations your challenged with, but my process
                    will be the encouragement of religion but not neglecting the bad 
                    that religion has done. I want to do my best to bring people closer to the ideals
                    that I picked up and modified over time, rebuild a community
                    that many races have lost over time.

                <h4>Where I'm from
                    <p>   I was born in manhattan but moved to Mount Vernon at 3 years old. I used to work 
                        at friendly worship center on rich ave and East Lncoln in Mount Vernon. I
                        have some coding experience as you can tell. But my best skill that I learned was to 
                        be kind to peopole and go the extra-mile. I hate when others are excluded so I do my best
                        to make them feel welcomed.

                <h3> Skills and talents
                    <p> I started writing stories for movies because, its what I like to discover. I fine joy in discovering new techniques to form a picture and belief inside
                        of the audiences head. I love miing and creating stories for rap and movies to express myself. It ecnourages me ot think before I speak.
                        At first I sought attention but, I'm discovering that it's not about me it is about the experiences and friends I make. I know can't do everythng thing alone
                        so, I get really excited when I meet other students that pursue careers in the music field.

                        <p>  In the near future, I see myself going to college and double majoring in business and film production.
                            I did some acting already, I'll have a better shot at getting noticed by running my own business
                            than hoping to gain popularity by pitching alone. Once I hav my bachelors degree in business I might make music videos.
                            But I'm going to make albums during highschool.

                        <h4> About me
                            <p>    I value integriy, and friendship, and family. I can be kind-hearted, but i do not 
                                tolerate any attempts of people trying to make others feel less than themselves. I love 
                                rapping and learning history as well as topics inside school. It's fun to me because, 
                                its cool to discover things that most people may not know. I love playing basketball.
                                But I like being with my friends more than practicing my skills alone. I like being in class,
                                and taking test with friends, it's scary but at the same time It's exciting. It's like precisely shooting 
                                a target on their focus points. But if we miss their is a small penalty, outside of highschool will be a time 
                                where those small penalties can cause a lot of damage. So I'd rather learn how to avoid them now rather than later.
